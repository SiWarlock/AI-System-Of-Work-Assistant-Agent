// §13.10a — Slice G1: the copilot.propose_knowledge tool + the full propose path (worker side).
//
// The SEMANTIC-write sibling of copilotPropose.ts's `copilot.propose_action` handler. When the
// agent calls the `copilot.propose_knowledge` tool, the model supplies ONLY an untrusted project
// INTENT (projectId/title/lifecycleState/optional summary). This module drives the full path:
//   derive  — `deriveCopilotProjectKnowledgePlan` (Slice B) turns the intent into a validated,
//             SERVER-scoped KnowledgeMutationPlan (server-derived note path/keys/workspace; the
//             model cannot supply a path or a workspace; provenanceOrigin=copilot_propose;
//             requiresApproval forced true; NO numeric percent — REQ-F-011).
//   route   — record the plan as a PENDING §9.8 semantic-mutation Approval + a pending-KMP row via
//             the Slice-E sink (`createApprovalsKnowledgeProposeSink`). NEVER a direct/auto write —
//             KnowledgeWriter commits it ONLY on owner approval (Slice F; safety rules 1+2).
// The handler returns a model-facing "pending approval" acknowledgement (an opaque ref), NEVER raw
// content. Fail-closed + never throws (typed Result throughout; the tool handler folds to a bounded
// cause CODE the model reads).
//
// ⚠ RUNNER PRECONDITIONS (the caller/runner MUST honor — not enforceable here; from the E/F reviews):
//   (a) `workspaceId` MUST be the agent job's SERVER-BOUND workspace, NEVER a model value. The sink's
//       WS-8 guarantee (and Slice B's path derivation) assume a server-bound workspaceId.
//   (b) `noteExists` MUST be resolved by a WS-8-scoped probe of the DERIVED note path at call time
//       (create-vs-patch). The runner computes it against `projectNotePath(workspaceId, projectId)` —
//       the SAME authority Slice B derives — so the probe and the write target the SAME file. (Slice B
//       stays pure by taking the resolved boolean.) The live probe + SDK-tool registration + the boot
//       flag are the DORMANT runner wiring (Slice G3/G4), gated on the §13.10a go-live gates.
//   (c) `sourceRef` is the proposal's grounding evidence (REQ-F-006: the plan cites ≥1 source).
