// Task 8.4 (integrator step) — the REAL @sow/db + dispatch-seam binding of the
// command-procedure ports. `commands.ts` declares the `ApprovalCommandPort` +
// `TriagePort` seams and the exactly-once / one-writer command logic; the FAKES are
// the unit-test seams. THIS module binds those ports to the real backends:
//   • `createDbApprovalCommandPort` — over the @sow/db `ApprovalRepository` CAS
//     (`get` + `applyTransition`, which itself drives the pure `decideApprovalCas`
//     apply | idempotent_noop | stale_conflict verdicts, unit 2.5). The exactly-once
//     compare-and-set lives ONCE in the repository — this adapter re-exposes it as
//     the command port with NO re-implementation, so a cross-channel double-apply /
//     replay collapses to exactly one durable transition (REQ-F-012, §9).
//   • `createDbTriagePort` — over an INJECTED dispatch seam. The ingestion re-entry
//     is a Temporal / Tool-Gateway effect (the real dispatch fn is wired at boot);
//     the port reuses the caller's `idempotencyKey` verbatim (replay-safe, ING-4).
//
// ONE-WRITER / TOOL-GATEWAY (root CLAUDE.md safety 1 + 3, §7/§8). NEITHER adapter
// writes an external system or Markdown directly. The approval command's only durable
// effect is the CAS on the @sow/db approval row (operational truth, not an external
// write); the triage command's only effect is the injected dispatch (Temporal /
// Tool-Gateway is the sole writer). A command NEVER opens a vendor client here.
//
// §16 typed boundary: every method returns a typed `Result` and never throws across
// the boundary. The @sow/db repo already returns `Result<..., DbError>`; the triage
// dispatch seam returns `Result<..., FailureVariant>` (already boundary-typed).
//
// IMPORT DIRECTION (root CLAUDE.md §2.5): apps/worker may import @sow/db + @sow/contracts;
// it never inverts the dependency. This is the worker-layer adapter the @sow/db
// `ApprovalRepository` doc calls for.

/**
 * Bind the 8.4 {@link ApprovalCommandPort} to the real @sow/db
 * {@link ApprovalRepository}. The port is EXACTLY the repository's `get` +
 * `applyTransition` surface — the exactly-once compare-and-set (and its
 * `decideApprovalCas` verdicts: genuine apply | idempotent no-op | stale/tombstoned
 * conflict) lives ONCE in the repository, so this adapter is a faithful pass-through
 * (no CAS re-implementation, no extra state). `applyTransition`'s `applied` flag —
 * true only for a genuine durable transition — is surfaced unchanged so the command
 * layer dispatches the downstream side effect exactly once (a no-op contender / a
 * replay never re-dispatches; REQ-F-012 / §9 / safety 3).
 *
 * The method bodies are one-liners that forward to the repo, but the adapter is a
 * NAMED boundary (not an inline `repo` pass) so the composition root binds a stable
 * port type and a future repo signature drift is caught HERE, at the seam.
