## <a id="1"></a>1. Hermes empty toolset → full mutating fallback — read-only Hermes runs MUST pass an explicit minimal toolset

**Date:** 2026-06-30.
**Source slice:** Phase-0 spike 0.3 — Hermes adapter surface (`docs/spikes/0.3-hermes-surface.md`).

During the Phase-0 Hermes adapter-surface spike (run live against the installed Hermes 0.17.0 via OpenRouter/DeepSeek-V4-Pro), the bounded meeting-close mock confirmed Hermes can be driven as a one-shot CLI subprocess with controlled tools (`hermes chat -q <prompt> -Q -t <toolset> -m <model> --provider <p> --max-turns N`), and that `-Q` emits clean parseable JSON, stop/cancel works (a SIGTERM mid-inference exits 124 with zero stdout → nothing reaches the schema gate = COST-1 cancel-with-no-partial-side-effect), and `-t clarify` restricts the run to a minimal toolset.

The sharp caveat: Hermes's `oneshot.py` `_normalize_toolsets` returns `None` for an **empty** `-t`, which falls back to the user's **full configured toolset — including mutating tools.** So "I passed `-t`, therefore the run is contained" is **false** when the toolset is empty: an empty toolset is maximally permissive, not minimally. This directly threatens the ING-7 untrusted-content invariant (a job consuming imported/untrusted content must run read-only / no mutating tools) and the candidate-data gate (a mutating Hermes tool could create an external side effect outside the Tool Gateway envelope).

Apply this when wiring the `HermesRuntimeAdapter`: a read-only or untrusted-content (ING-7) Hermes run MUST construct an **explicit minimal toolset** (seeded at a known read-only set, e.g. `clarify`) and assert it is **non-empty** before dispatch; admission must reject a Hermes `AgentJob` whose resolved toolset is empty or whose `ToolPolicy.allowsMutating` disagrees with the passed `-t`. Open edge case: the toolset semantics are a Hermes-version-specific behavior (observed on 0.17.0) — re-verify against the pinned Hermes version in the §12 runtime-adapter conformance suite, and treat a version bump as a re-validation trigger.

**Rule:** A read-only / untrusted-content (ING-7) Hermes run MUST pass an explicit, asserted-non-empty minimal toolset; an empty `-t` silently falls back to the user's full (mutating) config toolset.

## <a id="2"></a>2. A real read-only connector HTTP transport is a reusable `createConnectorHttpTransport(spec, deps)` over a vetted OUTBOUND SSRF predicate; connectors specialize with a per-vendor spec; the real transport+secrets stay UNBOUND at boot

**Date:** 2026-07-15.
**Source slice:** task 13.12 connector round 2 — slice 1 `c2c6525` (`@sow/policy` `isAllowedRemoteEndpoint`) + slice 2 `47c55c2` (`@sow/integrations` `createConnectorHttpTransport` + `createAsanaHttpTransport`).

The V1 connector adapters are built read-only over an injected `ConnectorTransport` (`makeConnector` base), but the only real transport in the tree was `createFileReadTransport` — every remote adapter was dormant. Giving them a real read-only HTTP transport is TWO reusable pieces, both mirroring the GbrainReadClient (knowledge Lesson 1) but for the OUTBOUND direction.

**(A) The SSRF predicate is the OUTBOUND INVERSE of the loopback guard.** gbrain's transport requires LOOPBACK (`isLoopbackEndpoint`); a connector requires an ALLOWLISTED REMOTE host and must REJECT loopback (SSRF-to-local). `isAllowedRemoteEndpoint(endpoint, allowedHosts)` = https + exact whole-host allowlist + non-loopback, **composed once** from the vetted `extractHost`/`isLoopbackHost` (root CLAUDE.md Lesson 4 — a safety predicate lives once; never re-parse a URL, because the parse is where the `evil.com/@127.0.0.1` userinfo-spoof holes live and are already closed). The exact-host allowlist is the primary control; loopback-reject is defense-in-depth. A hostname allowlist alone CANNOT catch DNS-rebinding — resolved-IP pinning + an `isPrivateHost` (RFC-1918/link-local/ULA) predicate are documented `arch_gap` residuals finalized when the real transport (which does the actual DNS resolution) binds at arming.

**(B) The transport is a reusable template, not a per-connector one-off.** `createConnectorHttpTransport(spec, deps): ConnectorTransport` runs: SSRF-guard-FIRST on the FINAL constructed URL (not just the base — so a crafted/tampered cursor can never smuggle an authority) → token from an injected `SecretsAccessor` (Authorization-header-only, never logged, fail-closed even when the accessor THROWS) → GET only (ING-7 read-only — type the method as the literal `"GET"` with no body) → a positive-2xx gate (a non-integer status fails closed) → parse → `spec.mapPage`. Every fault RETURNS a REDACTED typed `TransportFailure` (never throws across the `ConnectorTransport` seam; never the token/body/raw-cause — rule 7). The per-vendor `spec` carries `{baseUrl, allowedHosts, resourcePath, buildQuery, mapPage}`; the spec callbacks are WRAPPED in try/catch so a future throwing specialization can't escape unredacted (a reusable-boundary hardening). Reuse the canonical `payloadHash` for the `contentHash` (never hand-roll). `readScope` stays on the ADAPTER (`makeConnector({readScope})` → `request.readScope`), NOT the spec — a dual source drifts. The vendor wire shape is a documented `arch_gap` candidate (parsed fail-closed — a missing/renamed field is a `TransportFailure`, never a false page), confirmed at arming.

**Dormancy:** the real `HttpTransport` + `SecretsAccessor` + vendor token stay UNBOUND at boot (zero production importers ⇒ byte-equivalent); binding a real transport (real external network I/O) is the owner's arming HARD LINE. `@sow/integrations` does not depend on `@sow/providers`, so the small `HttpTransport`/`SecretsAccessor` seams are re-declared locally (mirror GbrainReadClient's same-reason re-declaration).

**Rule:** build a real read-only connector HTTP transport as a reusable `createConnectorHttpTransport(spec, deps)` producing a `ConnectorTransport` — SSRF-guard (the vetted OUTBOUND-inverse `isAllowedRemoteEndpoint`, composed once, never re-parse) on the FINAL url BEFORE token+dispatch · token header-only/fail-closed-even-on-throw · redacted typed `TransportFailure` behind a positive-2xx gate · wrapped spec callbacks · vendor wire shape a documented `arch_gap` candidate · ING-7 GET-only · `payloadHash` for the contentHash · `readScope` single-sourced at the adapter; the real transport+secrets stay UNBOUND at boot (byte-equivalent), and every connector specializes it with a per-vendor spec.

## <a id="3"></a>3. Ground every connector's candidate wire shape on Context7 at authoring; back-verify any connector built from memory before that — a candidate authored from training memory can silently defeat its own design intent

**Date:** 2026-07-15.
**Source slice:** task 13.12 round 3 — the Google Drive/Calendar specs (Context7-grounded from the start) + the Asana Context7 correctness-verify (`6908b0b`), which caught a real candidate bug in the round-2 Asana adapter.

A dormant connector's wire shape is a DOCUMENTED CANDIDATE (arch_gap, fail-closed, confirmed at arming) — but "candidate" is not a license to guess. A candidate authored from training memory can be subtly WRONG in a way that silently defeats its own design intent, and the fail-closed parsing won't catch it because the response still parses. Concrete case: the round-2 Asana list query was authored without `opt_fields`; Asana's `GET /tasks` returns COMPACT records (`gid`+`name`) UNLESS fields are named, so `modified_at` — the change token the connector's `contentHash` was DESIGNED to dedupe on — was never returned, degrading the hash to a token-less raw record. Every test passed (the compact record parses fine); only a field-by-field diff against the authoritative Context7 shape surfaced it.

Rule of practice: (1) at authoring, resolve the vendor on Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`; a High-reputation vendor-doc source; WebFetch the vendor docs only as a fallback) and ground the candidate's endpoint/params/pagination/response-shape/id/fault-map on it — not memory or a single fetch. (2) Back-verify any connector built BEFORE this practice with a field-by-field diff; a CONFORMANT axis just gets a Context7-citation comment, a DRIFT axis a proper TDD correction (RED pinning the corrected candidate, still fail-closed/arch_gap). (3) A required-param the vendor enforces but that needs OWNER data (an Asana scope GID, a Google calendarId) is an arming-era gap — NAME it, don't guess it.

**Rule:** ground every connector candidate wire shape on Context7 at authoring (endpoint/params/pagination/response/id/fault-map — never training memory or a single fetch), and back-verify any connector built pre-Context7 with a field-by-field diff (conformant ⇒ citation comment; drift ⇒ a TDD correction, fail-closed) — a memory-authored candidate can silently defeat its own design intent (e.g. a missing `opt_fields` dropping the change token a dedupe hash relies on) while every test still passes; a vendor-required param needing owner data is a NAMED arming gap, not a guess.
