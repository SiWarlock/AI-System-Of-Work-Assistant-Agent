## <a id="1"></a>1. Branded `z.infer` + `declaration: true` → TS4023 — use an explicit interface + `z.ZodType` annotation

**Date:** 2026-06-30.
**Source slice:** Phase-1 contract freeze (tasks 1.3–1.9), commits `512d731` / `4bdedf6`.

The shared branded IDs (`src/primitives/ids.ts`) carry their brand via a module-private `declare const __brand: unique symbol`. When a model's exported TypeScript type is derived with bare `export type X = z.infer<typeof XSchema>` and the schema embeds a branded field, the declaration emitter (`tsconfig` has `declaration: true`) must name `__brand` to write the `.d.ts` for `X` — but `__brand` is not exported, so `tsc` raises **TS4023 "… cannot be named"**. `--noEmit` still runs this check, so it fails the `pnpm typecheck` gate, not just a build.

The fix every branded model uses: declare an **explicit `interface X { … }`** (and an `interface XInput { … }` for the parse-input shape, since branded fields accept plain strings on input and the brand is applied on parse), then annotate the schema `export const XSchema: z.ZodType<X, z.ZodTypeDef, XInput> = z.object({…}).strict()…`. The nameable `X` sidesteps the emitter; `.strict()` unknown-key rejection and `.refine()` invariants are unaffected. For embedded sibling schemas, derive the input shape with `z.input<typeof SiblingSchema>` so the input interface stays in lockstep with the sibling's contract (see `knowledge-mutation-plan.ts`). `egress-policy.ts` is the canonical reference.

**Rule:** A model whose Zod schema embeds a branded ID must export an explicit `interface` + annotate the schema `z.ZodType<Out, ZodTypeDef, In>` — never rely on bare `z.infer` for the exported type.

## <a id="2"></a>2. Zod-as-source contract recipe (ADR-008) — generate the JSON Schema, freeze the field set, import shared shapes

**Date:** 2026-06-30.
**Source slice:** Phase-1 contract freeze (task 1.2 harness + 1.3–1.9), commit `8a42f13`.

Every frozen Appendix-A seam model is authored from **one** Zod schema and ships exactly four files: `src/models/<kebab>.ts` (the `.strict()` schema + `z.infer`/interface type + `X_SCHEMA_ID`), `schemas/<kebab>.schema.json` (the **generated** strict JSON Schema — `emitJsonSchema` via `zod-to-json-schema`, `additionalProperties:false`, never hand-written), `src/models/__snapshots__/<kebab>.snap` (the hand-authored top-level field-name set = the frozen spec), and `test/models/<kebab>.test.ts`. The test (a) freezes the field set against the `.snap`, (b) drift-guards the generated `schema.json` via `freezeGenerated`, (c) exercises valid/invalid fixtures + every `.refine`. The ajv-strict `defaultSchemaRegistry` globs `schemas/*.schema.json` by `$id`; `registry-all.test.ts` proves it compiles all + that every exported `*_SCHEMA_ID` resolves (REQ-S-006 coverage).

Two anti-drift disciplines are load-bearing: **(1)** shared sub-shapes (`ContextRef`, `SourceRef`, the KW mutation primitives, `CanonicalSourceRef`), shared enums, and branded-ID Zod schemas are authored **once** (`shared-shapes.ts` / `shared-enums.ts` / `zod-brands.ts`) and *imported* by composites — re-declaring one inline is the cross-track Finding the freeze exists to prevent. **(2)** `.refine()` conditional invariants are **not** expressible in the generated JSON Schema (`zod-to-json-schema` drops them), so they are enforced by Zod + the model's tests; the ajv gate stays structural (type/required/`additionalProperties`). Deeper cross-field validators are Phase-1 task 1.11. A field add/remove/rename must edit `ARCHITECTURE.md` Appendix A + the schema + the `.snap` in the same round.

**Rule:** Each Appendix-A model ships 4 files (`.ts`/`schemas/*.schema.json`/`__snapshots__/*.snap`/test); the JSON Schema is generated (never hand-written); import shared brands/enums/sub-shapes — never re-declare them inline.

## <a id="3"></a>3. The ajv `validate()` gate is structural-only — the candidate-data gate is a composition

**Date:** 2026-06-30.
**Source slice:** Phase-1 task 1.15 fixtures meta-test (commit `a039e86`); surfaced by the domain-layer consistency critic.

`zod-to-json-schema` (ADR-008) silently **drops `.refine`/`.superRefine`** — a Zod conditional invariant does not appear in the generated JSON Schema. So `validate(output, schemaId)` (the 1.2 ajv gate, REQ-S-006) checks only structure (types, required, `additionalProperties:false`) and **admits cross-field-invariant violations**: a `read_only` ToolPolicy with `allowsMutating:true` (ING-7 / safety rule 6), an unsourced `KnowledgeMutationPlan` (REQ-F-006 / safety rules 1 & 2), an EgressPolicy acknowledged without `acknowledgedAt` (safety rule 5), a `ParityReport` `cleanForServing` carrying a HARD divergence (§12 fail-closed). The 1.15 fixtures meta-test had to use a **full ajv+Zod biconditional** (the literal "validate() ok iff valid" was unsatisfiable for refine-only invalid fixtures), which is what exposed this.

Consequence — the candidate-data gate (safety rule 2) is a **composition**, never ajv alone: ajv `validate()` (structural) **+** the model's Zod `parse` (cross-field refines) **+** the §3 universal rules (`universal-rules.ts` + `no-inference.ts`) **+** the §5/§6/§7 predicates (egress veto, ING-7 admission, GCL visibility). Every §9 meeting validator, §5 admission gate, and §7 broker MUST run the full composition before any side effect. Treating the ajv gate as the whole gate is a reviewer-rejection condition (EVALUATION_CRITERIA).

**Rule:** Never treat the ajv `validate()` structural gate as the complete candidate-data gate — compose it with the model's Zod parse + the §3 universal rules + the §5/§6/§7 predicates.
