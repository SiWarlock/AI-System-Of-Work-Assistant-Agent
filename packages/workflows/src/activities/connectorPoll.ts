// @sow/workflows — slice 7.15 ACTIVITY: poll ONE connector through the §8 Connector
// Gateway (`runConnectorSync`) and project its outcome onto the driver-facing
// {@link ConnectorPollResult}.
//
// This is an ACTIVITY, NOT workflow code — it runs worker-side and MAY bind real
// adapters (the concrete ConnectorPort + the P2 ConnectorCursorRepository + a wall
// clock). It implements {@link ConnectorPollPort}. The pure driver
// (src/workflows/connectorSyncHealth.ts) NEVER imports the gateway or a real
// transport; it only RECEIVES the typed poll result from this seam. Tested with
// injected fakes (no real transport).
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING PIN (REQ-I-005 / the bug-class prior verify passes caught): the
// {@link ConnectorPollResult} this activity returns is projected DIRECTLY from the
// ACTUAL `ConnectorSyncResult` the gateway produced — `status`, `cursor`, `processed`
// come straight from the gateway's verdict, and `cursorAdvanced` is derived from the
// gateway `status === 'advanced'` (the ONLY status on which the gateway advanced +
// persisted the cursor). So the driver's degraded/queue branch reads the real
// reachability outcome that actually flowed through the cursor advance — never a decoy
// descriptor field. The activity NEVER fabricates an `advanced` on a held/degraded
// pass, and NEVER advances a cursor the gateway did not advance.
//
// §16: returns a typed Result — never throws. A gateway crash (the async call
// rejecting) is caught and folded to a typed {@link ConnectorPollError}.
